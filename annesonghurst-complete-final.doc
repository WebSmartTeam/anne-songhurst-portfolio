Contemporary oil paintings inspired by the Dutch Masters

Main Content:
"Paint what you love" -probably the best advice I was given many years ago. I have long been intrigued by the various metal, glass and ceramic vessels and the rich fabrics depicted in the paintings of the Dutch Masters, and over the years I have acquired a collection of objects to paint from antique shops, charity shops, online auctions and market stalls. Many of them are centuries old, still surviving long after their makers, and will still be valued by future generations. In contrast, the fruit and other perishables which I paint with them have usually deteriorated by the time the painting is finished.

ABOUT
URL: https://annesonghurst.co.uk/about

Complete Biography:

I was born in Ashford, Kent, in 1946, and have been drawing and painting since childhood. Despite showing significant artistic ability from an early age, I was not sufficiently confident to pursue art as a career. However, the compulsion to observe, draw and paint has remained constant throughout my life, and I have been painting full time since 1998.

For over thirty years I painted watercolours of birds, many of which were supplied to galleries around the UK and the United States. Other wildlife and botanical subjects have also featured strongly in my work, and have been exhibited in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and in London.

Over the last twenty years I have concentrated on still life in oils inspired by the Dutch and Flemish Masters. I do not seek to achieve photo-realism, but rather to convey an atmosphere of stillness and a timeless quality that comes with many days or weeks of close observation. Detail is built up in several layers of paint to bring out the various textures and the effects of light on everyday objects. I love rich colours and contrasting textures, and hope to inspire the viewer with the same enthusiasm.

Please see my gallery pages for examples of recent paintings, most of which have already been sold. The purpose of this site is to serve as an introduction to my work, a collection of my paintings is always on display at the Wren Gallery in Burford, Norton Way Gallery in Letchworth and The Marylebone Gallery, London.

The following is quoted from the Saatchi Online Magazine article in November 2009

ANNE SONGHURST: SAATCHI ONLINE CRITIC'S CHOICE by ANA FINEL HONIGMAN Anne Songhurst's luscious oil-on-board still lives are beautiful homages to genuine maturity. The Hertfordshire based artist was born in 1946 and her technique demonstrates her years of serious dedication to mastering her medium. Songhurst is one of a few self-taught artists whose work clearly benefited from being untouched by art school training, in which contemporary art schools tend to teach artists how to think rather than how to paint.

Songhurst's lovely, lush images carry within themselves and beautifully present all the connotations associated with the still-life tradition that she follows.
